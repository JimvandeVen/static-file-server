## Sources
For the basic code I used the [example](https://github.com/cmda-be/course-17-18/blob/master/examples/plain-server/index.js) made by Titus Wormer.

For the code to read the directory I looked into [the code](https://github.com/timruiterkamp/http-server/blob/master/index.js) from Tim Ruiterkamp.

I tried to write as much as I could on my own.
